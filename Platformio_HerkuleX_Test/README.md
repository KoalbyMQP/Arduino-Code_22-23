# Platformio Test

Find all connected HerkuleX motors by looping through IDs and attempting to read angles. Set the found HerkuleX motor LEDs to green and print out their IDs and angles.

This code serves as a test for uploading code to the Arduino with the Platformio framework. The HerkuleX Arduino library appears to be built-in to the platformio Arduino Mega 2560 framework, but has yet to be tested as of writing this.
